# kVIS3 -- Kai's Data visualisation and manipulation tool (3rd edition)

## Management and visualisation of time sampled experimental data with emphasis on flight test data

Inspired by the SIDPAC GUI by E.A. Morelli.

## How to run:

Run 'kVIS3.m' after installing the two toolboxes in the `Contributed` folder and creating a `kVIS_preferences.m` file from the provided template. 

kVIS3 requires a *Board Support Package*, specified in the preferences file, to import and process data from the user's data acquisition system.
