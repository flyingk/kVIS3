The application design is fully modular to allow for easy implementation of custom functionality. The functionality to interpret and handle the data files from the recording system has been moved into a separate component, called the Board Support Package (BSP). The kVIS3 application does not contain any functionality specific to the data format and content of the user data. This allows for a single application to be used for multiple, potentially proprietary, data formats, while still be open and easily expandable. The user can also add functionality to the BSP without need to change the main application. kVIS3 contains all the generic functionality described in this document. All BSP specific functionality must be documented in a BSP help. kVIS3 is based on a generic file format for the test data, which arranges the data in a convenient and easy to manage tree format. The file format also saves auxiliary data like event markers and test information together with the data in one place. The BSP is responsible to generate the FDS file format form the user supplied data format. This includes the generation of the tree structure, which can be entirely defined by the user. Usage of kVIS3 is mostly straightforward, with standard concepts, like tooltips and right click actions, available throughout. This documentation for the more complex functions is work in progress...","title":"Home"},{"location":"index.html#kvis3-documentation","text":"","title":"kVIS3 Documentation"},{"location":"index.html#overview","text":"kVIS3 provides a framework to visualise and process time sampled data.

If available in the dataset, the following can be integrated into the report: A table generated from aircraft info A table generated from test info A map plot Figures derived from custom plot definitions Figures derived from a BSP function The template itself is a LaTeX file with some extra kVIS specific commands. All other LaTeX functions can be used to design a report. The additional commands are defined as LaTeX comments to not interfere with the normal document compilation. These special comments have the form %_kVIS_xxxxx where xxxx is the actual command. Therefore, comments that resemble this form are reserved for those additional kVIS commands. Available Report Commands %_kVIS_make_title : Generate Document title with data set name %_kVIS_test_info : Generates a table from the test info fields %_kVIS_aircraft_properties : Generates a table from aircraft properties %_kVIS_map_plot{xxx} : Generates a map plot (if available in the BSP). xxx is the standard Group/Channel tupel to define the track colour, for example airspeed. %_kVIS_plot[xxx]{yyy.xlsx} : Generates figures from custom plot definition yyy.xslx . If the plot definition contains more than one subplot, xxx is a comma separated list of subplot indices to include. Leave empty to include all subplots. Each subplot becomes a separate figure at this stage. Only the Excel plot definitions are supported. The figure caption is generated from the dedicated column in the plot definition file (column I). %_kVIS_bsp_fcn_eval{xxx} : Evaluate BSP - function xxx and generate figures from the returned figure handles of the function. The function can return an array of figure handles. One plot per array entry will be generated. How to use the Report Generator 1) Create a normal LaTex document with all required content (Header, Body, Styling). The tex file must compile without error into a document. 2) Add the kVIS commands where desired 3) Save the .tex file to the BSP ReportGeneration folder 4) Refresh the Reports tab, the new template will appear in the list 5) Click on the template name to run it, or edit it with the pencil button 6) After running a template, it will ask for a folder to save the files in 7) The generator runs and produces all plots and other data items 8) At the end the folder contains a new LaTeX file, where all special commands have been translated into LaTeX code, and all images have been generated into a img folder. If a compatible LaTeX installation is found, also a PDF file of the report is generated automatically. Otherwise, the generated .tex file can be compiled manually.","title":"Report Generator"},{"location":"reportFcn.html#report-generator","text":"The integrated report generator can generate a LaTeX document from a template, which includes data from various sources in kVIS.
